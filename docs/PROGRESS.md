# Implementation progress

This log records verified milestones and remaining risks. The product brief is the stopping contract.

## Plan

1. Establish pinned workspaces, trust-boundary ADRs, and strict native/browser quality gates.
2. Implement PXCL spans, indentation-aware lexer/parser, formatter, fixtures, and stable diagnostics.
3. Add resolution, type checking, typed assets, typed IR, tasks, and cross-mode code generation.
4. Build deterministic runtime, worker sandbox, indexed graphics, input, audio, and replay primitives.
5. Implement project persistence, canonical `.pxc`, CLI/watch/LSP, shell, and integrated editors.
6. Add debugger/profiler/time travel and use pack-in cartridges to calibrate public facilities.
7. Finish PWA/export, documentation, accessibility and visual validation, then run the full audit.

These are execution groups rather than substitutes for the brief's thirteen milestone outcomes.
Each group may produce several coherent commits, and integration occurs throughout.

## 2026-09-07 — Milestone 1: foundation

- Inspected the initially empty Git repository and complete authoritative product brief.
- Verified Node.js 22.22.2, pnpm 10.32.1, Rust/Cargo 1.98.0, and Git 2.55.0.
- Installed user-local Rust 1.98 components for rustfmt, Clippy, and WebAssembly compilation.
- Added the Cargo/pnpm workspace, initial static studio shell, frozen experimental constants, ADRs,
  proprietary notice, and quality-gate commands.
- Verification: `make setup` and `./scripts/check.sh`; TypeScript format/lint/type tests, Vitest,
  browser production build, Rust formatting/Clippy/tests/native build, and release WASM build pass.

## Current risks

- The language, runtime, studio tools, debugger, packer, LSP, exporter, and games remain to be built.
- WebGL2 and Web Audio behavior will need both state tests and hands-on browser inspection.
- Worker hardening must be validated against concrete denial and runaway-loop cases; it must not be
  described as stronger isolation than the browser actually provides.
